2Q   what are identifiers in java?
ans   Identifiers in Java are symbolic names used for identification
   1)   They must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). They cannot start with a         digit12.
    2)They can only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. They cannot contain any other   characters, such as spaces, symbols, or punctuation marks12.  
    3)They are case-sensitive, meaning that myVariable and MyVariable are different identifiers12.
    4)They cannot be any of the reserved words in Java, such as int, if, class, etc12.
    There are 53 reserved words in Java, which have special meanings and functions in the language.

3Q   what is final class in java? 

ans  A final class in Java is a class that is declared with the final keyword. This means that the class cannot be extended or inherited by any other class. 
 ========================================================================================================================================================================================
4Q   what are the two ways tto make a class final?
ans  Declaring the class itself as final: When you declare a class with the final keyword, it means that the class cannot be subclassed or extended. 

      Making specific methods final: You can also mark individual methods within a class as final. This means that these methods cannot be overridden by subclasses
 ========================================================================================================================================================================================
5Q   CAN WE CRATE A INSTANCE OF A FINAL CLASS IN ANOTHER CLASS?
ANS   YES  WE CRATE A INSTANCE OF A FINAL CLASS IN ANOTHER CLASS.
 ========================================================================================================================================================================================
6Q   what is volatile keyword used for?
ANS  In Java, the volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable may be modified asynchronously by multiple threads.
       It ensures that when a thread reads a volatile variable,
      it   always gets the most recent value written to it by any other thread.
 ========================================================================================================================================================================================

7Q   WHAT IS THE USE OF TRANSIENT KEYWORD?
ANS  In Java, the transient keyword is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized when the object containing it is serialized.
         Serialization is the process of converting an  object into a stream of bytes, which can be persisted to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database.

8Q   WHAT  ARE THE TYPES OF CASTING ?
 ans  primitive type==   When the data is casted from one primitive type ( like int, float, double to another 
                         primitive type, then it is called primitive casting

   derived casting == When the data is casted from one derived type to another derived type, then it is called 
                      derived casting. 
 ========================================================================================================================================================================================

9Q   WHAT IS BOXING AND UNBOXING ?
ANS   Boxing: ==It's the process of converting a primitive type into its equivalent wrapper class.

       nboxing ==It's the reverse process of converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type.

10Q   DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KEYWORD LITERAL IDENTIFEERR IN JAVA  ?
ANS    Keywords: These are reserved words in Java that have predefined meanings and functionalities. They are part of the language syntax and cannot be used as identifiers
      (such as   variable names or method names). Examples of keywords include class, public, static, void, if, else, for, etc. 
      
       Literals: These are constant values that are directly used in the code. They represent fixed values and can be of various types, such as numeric literals
          (integers, floating-point numbers), string literals, character literals, boolean literals, etc


      Identifiers: These are names given to variables, methods, classes, etc., created by the programmer. 
      Identifiers are user-defined and used to represent various elements in the code.   They must follow certain rules,
       such as starting with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, and    can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Identifiers cannot be the same as keywords.
